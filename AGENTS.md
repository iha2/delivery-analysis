# Instructions for AI assistants

For **humans running reports**: all setup, monthly commands, CLI options, output columns, and combined-workbook format are in **[README.md](README.md)**. Do not duplicate that material here — link to the relevant README section instead.

This file covers **what agents should do** when a user asks for help (including users with little or no programming experience).

## Source of truth (README sections)

| Topic | README section |
|-------|----------------|
| One-time setup (`uv`, `gh`, PAT, SSO) | [Install and setup](README.md#install-and-setup) |
| Monthly combined Excel (primary workflow) | [Monthly combined workbook (CEDT)](README.md#monthly-combined-workbook-cedt) |
| Agency / team tabs (`config/teams.yaml`) | [Agency / team tabs](README.md#agency--team-tabs) |
| Output directory (`--output-dir`, `GITHUB_ANALYSIS_RESULTS`) | [Output directory configuration](README.md#output-directory-configuration) |
| macOS / Linux / Windows, no `~/Dev` required | [macOS guide](#macos-macbook--setup-and-monthly-report), [Windows guide](#windows--setup-and-monthly-report), [Platforms and paths](README.md#platforms-and-paths) |
| Single-repo CLI | [Single-repo quick start](README.md#single-repo-quick-start), [Commands](README.md#commands) |
| Column / metric definitions | [Monthly metrics](README.md#monthly-metrics) and related tables in README |
| Architecture (for code changes) | [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) |

**Local output folder** (generated artifacts, not in git): default `~/github-analysis-results/` — or whatever the user set in `GITHUB_ANALYSIS_RESULTS`. See [Output directory configuration](README.md#output-directory-configuration). Do not assume `~/Dev` or a fixed clone path.

## Default behavior (do not override unless user asks)

Production monthly runs use **`./scripts/run_monthly.sh YYYY-MM`**, which applies the five CEDT repos, **`--merged-only`**, US Eastern dates, and workers documented in README. See [Monthly combined workbook (CEDT)](README.md#monthly-combined-workbook-cedt).

---

## When the user asks for a report

**You run it.** Do not hand them a long shell script unless they must complete GitHub login in a browser (OAuth) or create a PAT.

### Canonical commands (from repo root)

Discover the **clone path** (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) and **output directory** (`echo $GITHUB_ANALYSIS_RESULTS` or default `~/github-analysis-results`). Then:

| Request | You run |
|---------|---------|
| Full calendar month | `./scripts/run_monthly.sh YYYY-MM` |
| Dry-run | `./scripts/run_monthly.sh YYYY-MM --dry-run` |
| Partial window | `./scripts/run_cedt_trio.sh START END` — dates per README |
| Combined Excel only (data already fetched) | `uv run python scripts/combine_person_summaries.py …` — see README [Rebuild combined Excel only](README.md#rebuild-combined-excel-only-no-github-fetch) |

**Deliverable path:** `{results-base}/YYYY-MM/combined-YYYY-MM.xlsx` (or `{results-base}/{START}_to_{END}/…` for partial runs) — report the **resolved full path**, not a hardcoded `~/Dev/...` location. Team tabs come from `config/teams.yaml`.

### Agency / team tabs (agents)

Full schema and examples: [Agency / team tabs](README.md#agency--team-tabs).

| User asks | You do |
|-----------|--------|
| Add / edit a team or member | Edit [`config/teams.yaml`](config/teams.yaml) only — `name` (sheet tab), optional `team_banner` (row-1 banner), `members[].name` + `members[].user` |
| Rebuild after roster change (data already fetched) | Re-run `combine_person_summaries.py` on that run’s directory — do **not** re-fetch GitHub unless they ask |
| “What’s on the TresPi tab?” | Point to README: banner = `team_banner`, rows = Totals filtered to that roster |

Do **not** hardcode team rosters in Python or shell scripts.

### Agent checklist

1. **`gh auth status`** — if it fails, walk the user through [Authenticate with GitHub](README.md#4-authenticate-with-github); you cannot complete browser OAuth for them.
2. Confirm **which month or date range** in plain language before running.
3. Run the command from the **tool repo root** with `working_directory` set if Cursor shell output is empty.
4. On failure, read **`{repo}-*_run.log`** in the user's **run subdirectory** — do not guess.
5. Tell the user the **full path** to the combined `.xlsx` when done (under `{results-base}/YYYY-MM/` or `{START}_to_{END}/`).
6. **Do not commit** generated `.tsv` / `.xlsx` / `.json` / `.log` files.

## Helping non-technical users

Use README for factual details; your job is to **execute and explain in plain language**.

### What you do vs what they do

| Step | Who |
|------|-----|
| Install `uv` / `gh`, clone repo, `uv sync` | You guide using [Install and setup](README.md#install-and-setup); they may need to approve installs |
| `gh auth login` / PAT / org SSO | **They** must authenticate in browser or paste a token |
| `./scripts/run_monthly.sh YYYY-MM` | **You** run this |
| Open the Excel file | Give the **full path** under their output dir; macOS Finder **Go to Folder**, Windows Explorer `%USERPROFILE%\…`, or Linux file manager — see [Platforms and paths](README.md#platforms-and-paths) |

### User intent → your response

| User says | You do |
|-----------|--------|
| “Run the July report” / “Last month’s metrics” | Resolve `YYYY-MM`, run `./scripts/run_monthly.sh YYYY-MM`, report output path |
| “Where is the file?” | Give Finder path above; deliverable name `combined-YYYY-MM.xlsx` |
| “It failed” / “Nothing happened” | Read latest `*_run.log`; explain in non-jargon (see below) |
| “Do I need to run anything?” | No — if setup is done, you run the script; they only log in to GitHub if auth is missing |
| “What’s in the Totals sheet?” | Point to [Monthly combined workbook (CEDT)](README.md#monthly-combined-workbook-cedt) |
| “Add another agency / team tab” | Edit `config/teams.yaml` per [Agency / team tabs](README.md#agency--team-tabs); rebuild combined Excel if they already have a run |
| “Change the TresPi banner title” | Set `team_banner` on that team in `config/teams.yaml`, then rebuild combined Excel |

### Relaying errors (plain language)

| Log / symptom | Tell the user |
|---------------|----------------|
| `gh auth status` / not logged in | “GitHub isn’t signed in on this machine — run `gh auth login` once (I can walk you through it).” |
| 404 / not found on repo | “Your token can’t see the repo — check PAT `repo` scope and org SSO authorization.” |
| Rate limit / 403 | “GitHub throttled us — wait ~an hour and we can retry.” |
| Run succeeded | “Your report is ready at …/combined-YYYY-MM.xlsx — open that file in Excel.” |

Always state expected **wait time (~15–30 minutes)** once before a full fetch.

## Working on the codebase

| Task | Where |
|------|--------|
| Add CLI command | [docs/extending-the-cli.md](docs/extending-the-cli.md) |
| Pipeline / phases | [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) |
| Combined workbook / team tabs | `scripts/combine_person_summaries.py` |
| Agency rosters | `config/teams.yaml` (not Python) |
| Defaults (org, output dir) | `github_analysis/config.py` |

After changing CLI, columns, teams config schema, or monthly workflow: **update README.md first**, then adjust this file only if agent behavior changes.
